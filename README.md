# My resume

This project is my very first HTML - CSS project.

It was carried out by following the training "Learn to create your website with HTML5 and CSS3" on the OPENCLASSROOMS platform but also in self-study via research on the internet.

This project allowed me to train in HTML/CSS languages before following my training at O'Clock as a Fullstack JavaScript Developer
